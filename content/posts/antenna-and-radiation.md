# Antennas 


An antenna is a device used for transmission r reception of electromangentic waves, allowing radio frequency
communication between distant locations across empty space or other material media. 
antennas are fabricated using conducting and/or dielectric materials,are designed with desirable radiation
The employ the I/O and may be used for exciting the antenna radition frequenc  syignals received by the antenna to an output load

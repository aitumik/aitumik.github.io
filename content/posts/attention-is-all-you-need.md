# Transformers
![Transformers](/transformers.jpg)

Gone are the days when computers were programmed using punch-cards. Those were
some dark days. Interesting things are beginning to happen in the computing world. 
We can speak to and chat with these machines. This is just the beginning, programs
written in high level languages will face the same fate that befell assembly and
machine code. Future programmers and hackers will use natural languages or even
a synthentic one made to have the best of both worlds. This is the future I am 
looking forward to.

A small anecdote on robotics is that since we can now program using natural 
languages i.e english e.t.c and with the advent of humanoid robots, we then 
have humans that can be programmed. What a time to be alive!! Imagine having 
a companion like that, and they might start off as clunky metals but they will
eventually get good.

They are coming, its not a question of if its a question of when and that when
is nigh

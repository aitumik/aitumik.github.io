## The Power of One Point of Reference: How to Predict the Future with Certainty

We are constantly making decisions in our lives, from the simplest to the most complex. At any given moment in time, we have one point of reference to act upon and two to observe - the past and the future. Understanding this concept can help us make better decisions and predict the future with more accuracy.

The past is set in stone and cannot be changed, but we can write to it at each moment as we transition through time. This means that we can learn from our past experiences and use that knowledge to make better decisions in the present and future. On the other hand, the future is uncertain and can only be predicted based on the actions we take in the present.

Each moment in time contains a set of actions that can be performed, and all of these actions are time-bound. This means that we have a limited amount of time to make a decision and take action. The benefit of this is that by choosing the right actions, we can predict the future with a certain degree of certainty.

For example, if you're interviewing for a job, talking to the interviewer is just one action in the set of actions that you can perform. But within that set of actions, there is another subset of actions, such as the words you choose to say, the tone of your voice, and the body language you display. These actions can be arranged in such a way that they can sway the interviewer to see things from your perspective.

The cost of choosing the wrong or least optimal decision can be expensive, so it's important to choose wisely. You can either pay the price now or later, but the question is when to pay it. In some cases, delaying the payment can actually lead to better results and more accurate predictions, while in others, it's best to pay the price as soon as possible if it doesn't bring you any value.

Making the right decision can be a daunting task, filled with resistance. To overcome this resistance, you need to employ principles and algorithms, have hope, set aspirations, practice delayed gratification, and be consistent. Consistency is key, as it leads to success in the long run.

So, what happens after you've made the best decision at any given moment? It may take a few days or weeks before you start seeing results, depending on the speed at which you perform the chosen actions. But rest assured, after you finish one action, there will always be another one waiting for you.

In conclusion, by understanding the concept of one point of reference and the power of choosing the right actions, we can make better decisions and predict the future with greater accuracy. By embracing principles and algorithms, having hope, setting aspirations, practicing delayed gratification, and being consistent, we can overcome resistance and achieve success in the long run.
